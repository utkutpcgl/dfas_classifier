The dataset was trained on the dataset on which istanbul_long_short samples were picked actively (with active learning - only mislabeled samples are picked). Also istanbul_short_errors_train samples were picked (actively again).

Small samples were not filtered unlike previous models, this model still fails to discard pedestrian lights and left-right traffic lights as other.
