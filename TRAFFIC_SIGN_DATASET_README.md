This model this model was trained on `/mnt_dgx_ssd/utku/raw_datasets/Traffic_sign_light_classification/sign/TS_classification_dataset_combined`. The dataset is generated from multiple datasets combined with the scripts in `utkusdatamanager/traffic_sign_light/traffic_sign`.
. The code execution order is specified in the code file names. Creating the other dataset, adjusting imbalance parameters, applying active learning (adding errors to train) was most important steps.

All datasets can be found in `/mnt_dgx_ssd/utku/raw_datasets/Traffic_sign_light_classification/sign/TS_combined_datasets`
