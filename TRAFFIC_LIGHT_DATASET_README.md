This model this model was currently trained on `/mnt_dgx_ssd/utku/raw_datasets/Traffic_sign_light_classification/light/light_dataset_v1_classification_dataset_combined`. The dataset is generated from multiple datasets combined with the scripts in The dataset is generated from multiple datasets combined with the scripts in `utkusdatamanager/traffic_sign_light/traffic_sign`. The code execution order is specified in the code file names. Creating the other dataset, adjusting imbalance parameters, applying active learning (adding errors to train) was most important steps.
